UI Pattern
Pick one of the UI patterns below. You’ll need to create some data to populate your UI with. For this, pick any interest of yours and compile the data for it.

Good examples include TV show characters and movies or books in a series.

List of UI Patterns
You may choose from the following list of UI patterns:

MODAL
When a user clicks on a link, a box should appear in the center of the screen with the details for the item that the user clicks on. The box should have some way for the user to close the box and see the full list of items.

HAMBURGER MENU
There should be a hamburger icon in the top right corner. When a user clicks on it, a menu should appear from off of the right side of the screen with a list of menu items. When the user clicks on the menu item, the contents in the center of the page should change to show the details for that item. The user should be able to see which item is currently selected. The user should be able to close the menu by clicking the hamburger menu again.

ACCORDION
The user should see a list of items. When they click on one, the space below the item expands to reveal the content related to that item. When the user clicks on the item again, the revealed content becomes hidden.

TABS
The user sees a row of tabs above a content area. When the user clicks on one of the tabs, the content in the content area changes based on which tab the user clicked.

SLIDER
The user should see the content on the screen with ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’ buttons. When they click on the ‘Next’ button, the slider should shift to show the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the ‘Previous’ button, the slider should shift to show the previous items in the list. If there is no next or previous items, the slider could loop to the other end of the list or prevent the user from clicking those buttons.
